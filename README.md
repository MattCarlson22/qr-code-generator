# QR-Code-Generator

#### Video Demo: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_4n9UeMNYE

#### Description: This is a simple webapp that I made for my CS50 final project using the React Framework. It takes in text in a textbox and instantly generates a QR code on the webpage, which can be downloaded as a .png file by clicking the download button. The QR code also changes automatically as you put in text, removing the need for a generate button.
