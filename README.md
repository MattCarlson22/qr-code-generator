#### Description: 
This is a simple webapp that I made for my CS50 final project using the React Framework. It takes in text in a textbox and instantly generates a QR code on the webpage, which can be downloaded as a .png file by clicking the download button. The QR code also changes automatically as you put in text, removing the need for a generate button. To do this, I had to look into features in React such as useState which allows the state of something to be changed on the fly. I also learned about components, which I used to create both the form the QR code. To get the QR code, I used a library called qrcode.react, which is a component that allows a qr code to be generated in basically one line of code. The last thing that I did was create the ability to download the QR code, which initially did not work. I originally thought you would be able to just right click the image and save-as, but with reactive state, this would not work. Instead what I did was grab the line of text that is used to generate the QR code and generate an image separately, which is then downloaded when the download button is pressed. Overall, I learned a lot about the React framework in doing this project, and I think it was a good start into the world of React.
